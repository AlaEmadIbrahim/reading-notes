**Role-based access control (RBAC)** restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control

### EXAMPLES OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL

Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

- **Management role scope** – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
- **Management role group** – you can add and remove members.
- **Management role** – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
- **Management role assignment** – this links a role to a role group.

By adding a user to a role group, the user has access to all the roles in that group. If they are removed, access becomes restricted. Users may also be assigned to multiple groups in the event they need temporary access to certain data or programs and then removed once the project is complete.

Other options for user access may include:

- **Primary** – the primary contact for a specific account or role.
- **Billing** – access for one end-user to the billing account.
- **Technical** – assigned to users that perform technical tasks.
- **Administrative** – access for users that perform administrative tasks.

### BENEFITS OF RBAC

**1. Reducing administrative work and IT support** : With RBAC, you can reduce the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role. Instead, you can use RBAC to add and switch roles quickly and implement them globally across operating systems, platforms and applications.

**2. Maximizing operational efficiency**: RBAC offers a streamlined approach that is logical in definition. Instead of trying to administer lower-level access control, all the roles can be aligned with the organizational structure of the business and users can do their jobs more efficiently and autonomously.

**3. Improving compliance:** All organizations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. With an RBAC system in place, companies can more easily meet statutory and regulatory requirements for privacy and confidentiality as IT departments and executives have the ability to manage how data is being accessed and used. This is especially significant for health care and financial institutions, which manage lots of sensitive data such as PHI and PCI data.
