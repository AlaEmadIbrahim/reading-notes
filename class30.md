# Read: Hash Tables

## Implementation: Hash Tables

Hash Tables:

- A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is hashed using a hash function to determine its index in an array, enabling rapid access to values based on their keys.

- Hash tables provide efficient data storage and retrieval by using a hashing function to map keys to array indices, allowing for constant-time average case operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

- Hashing: The process begins by applying a hash function to the key, which generates a unique hash code.
Index Calculation: The hash code is converted into an index within the array using a modulus operation to ensure it fits within the array's bounds.

- Collision Handling: Since different keys can produce the same hash code (collision), various collision resolution strategies, such as chaining or open addressing, are used to manage this.
