- In React, useReducer and useContext are hooks that can be combined to simplify how an application's state is managed. useReducer streamlines handling complex state changes by using a reducer function and initial state, while useContext allows components to access shared data without prop drilling. Together, they provide an organized approach to state management, centralizing logic and promoting cleaner code.
