# Reading: Access Control (ACL)

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- A security model that defines and manages user access to resources based on their roles within an organization. It focuses on assigning permissions to roles rather than directly to individual users.

Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- Admin - Superadmin - User

What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- Define permissions - Assign permissions to roles - Assign roles to users - determine the different roles and responsibilities within it.

If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- Authorization, in the context of access control, is the process of granting or denying permissions to a user after their identity has been authenticated. It determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on their authenticated identity.

Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.

- Role permission , assignment, hierarchy.

Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

- Controls access to different parts of a computer system or application based on the roles people have in an organization. Instead of giving each person specific permissions, RBAC groups people into roles and assigns permissions to those roles.

What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.

- Each role is assigned a set of access rights or permissions that define what actions and resources the users with that role can access. This approach allows for a more streamlined and scalable access control system, as permissions are managed at the role level rather than individually for each user.

Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?

- User identity is confirmed through authentication, the authorization process begins, determining what actions or resources the user is allowed to access.

Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.

- Enhanced productivity
- Scalability
- Let user administration and access management processes. It allows for efficient role-based provisioning, making it easier to grant or revoke access when employees change roles or leave the organization.
