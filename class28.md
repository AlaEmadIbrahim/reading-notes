## useEffect hook

What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?

How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?

What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?

- To allowing actions before unmounting or when dependencies change, preventing memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
