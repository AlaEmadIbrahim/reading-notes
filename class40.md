# React Native

Core Components of React Native:
- View
- Text
- Image

- React Native solves the problem of building mobile apps with a single codebase that can run on multiple platforms.

- Building Blocks of a React Native app include components, state management, and navigation. This is similar to a React app but tailored for mobile platforms.

- Expo provides a development framework and a set of tools for building React Native applications quickly and easily.

Difference between React Native and Expo:

- React Native is a framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and native components, offering more control but requiring more setup.
- Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native that simplifies app development, but may limit some advanced customization options.
Expo Snack allows you to quickly prototype and develop React Native apps directly in your web browser.

- Eject in the context of Expo means transitioning an Expo project to a standard React Native project.
