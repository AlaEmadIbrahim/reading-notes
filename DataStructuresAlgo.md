# Prep: Data Structures and Algorithms

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
Memory use is so important to give high performance, when data organized and stored it will be easy to search saveing time less memory.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
By base-case using if...else statement and we can use the use hook.
