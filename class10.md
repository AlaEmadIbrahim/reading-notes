# Stacks and Queues

- Stacks follow a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) approach.

= While queues adhere to a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) approach.

- Understanding the differences between these structures is essential for designing efficient algorithms and solving various programming problems.

## FIFO

First In First Out

- This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

### LILO

Last In Last Out

- This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
